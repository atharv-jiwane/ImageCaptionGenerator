# ImageCaptionGenerator
Using the Flickr8K Dataset, I have implemented a merged architecture of CNN + LSTM (RNN) using the Keras Functional API, to gnerate meaningful and relevant captions for images.
In case, the "project.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook fails to render, please run the "main_project.py" file which contains the same code.
